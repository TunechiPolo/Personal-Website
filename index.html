                <!-- 1. What are you currently doing (in regard to my career) and how did I get here? -->
                Currently, I am switching professional roles to a more development-focused role. After graduating college with a degree in Information Systems, I've taken on two different roles. My first role out of college was as an IT Developer/Engineer for the enterprise information technology company Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). My second role following my position with HPE was as an Associate in KPMG's Global Trade Technology practice. In both roles I supported business and IT users with global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementations, system fixes, and system improvements in their ERP production systems.

                <!-- 2. In terms of the work I do, what aspects am I most passionate about and why? -->
                In terms of the work that I do, I am most passionate about working with the latest technology and helping people use that technology. I really enjoy working with a diverse team and building robust business solutions with the latest technology. I've always enjoyed being on teams that were building custom solutions, and taking ownership of those solutions.</p>

                <p class="about-2-2">
                <!-- 3. What do I consider some of my biggest professional and personal accomplishments? -->
                I've got numerous professional and personal accomplishments that I am proud of. One of my greatest personal accomplishments is being the first person in my family to graduate with a college degree, simultaneously while  balancing work and full-time enrollment. Professionally, I am very proud to have had an internship with a medical device company that develops life-saving medical equipment, and then guiding that company to implement a global trade management enterprise system allowing them to define and support complex import and export trade processes.

                <!-- 4. What am I looking for right now? (e.g. considering a career change. include email address in last sentence) -->
                I am considering a career change to a development focused role. I specialize in the web technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but hope to become a full-stack developer.</p>
