                <p>Currently, I am switching professional roles toward web development. I graduated from California State University, Chico with a degree in Management Information Systems and have taken on two different roles in the software industry. My first role out of college was with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as an IT Developer/Engineer on their Platform Development team. My second role, following my position with HPE, was an Associate in KPMG’s Global Trade Technology (GTT) practice. In both roles, I supported business and IT users with global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementations, system fixes, and system improvements in their production systems.

                    <br>
                In terms of the work I do, I am most passionate about working with the latest technology and helping people use that technology. I’ve always enjoyed being a part of a diverse team and building robust business solutions with the latest technology. I love the collaboration between clients, business users, and IT users to overcome business problems. Once a solution is implemented, I’ve always been proud to take ownership of those solutions.</p>

                <p>I’ve got numerous personal and professional accomplishments I am proud of. One of my proudest accomplishments is being the first person in my family to graduate with a college degree, while simultaneously balancing work and full-time enrollment. On campus I was a yearly member of two extracurricular clubs: the BIS Society and SAP Club. A memorable accomplishment after graduating was being featured in a Philadelphia Inquirer article about how millennials are handling student loan debt. You can read it <strong><a id="news-link" href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/philly-millennials-college-student-loans-debt-20180614.html">here</a></strong>.

                    <br>
                Professionally, I am proud of being the developer lead for a custom credit cleanse tool that enabled HPE to lend large lines of credit to customers. For KPMG I was an important resource in aiding GTT’s sister-team, International Tax, as a superuser of their custom tax modeler program. When doing implementations of global trade management software for clients I took ownership of configuration, integration, and testing of sanctioned-party list screening, as well as delivering training guides for business and IT users at the project’s conclusion.

                I am pursuing a career change to a development-focused role. I specialize in the web technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but am anticipating to become a full-stack software engineer. You can contact me at: <strong>mikemac@gmail.com.</strong></p>
